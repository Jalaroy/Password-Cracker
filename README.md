# Password-Cracker

This project consists currently of two Python codes. One is for cracking hashes for a pin code(planing on passwords too), while the second involves bruteforcing a website. 

## Why

I found it interesting to create something similar to Burp Suite Intruder, and it also provided a good opportunity to learn new libraries.

## To Do
- [ ] Originally made for linux. Fix so windows also can do this
- [ ] Figure out if it possible to speed it up more
- [ ] Add more hashes to decrypt.
- [ ] Integrate rockyou.txt and other dictionaries for hash cracking.
- [ ] Fix the CSV file (might do it later).
- [ ] Implement the same functionality in other programming languages and compare their performance.
- [ ] Explore ways to make the website bruteforcer more effective.
- [ ] Conduct a thorough analysis of the results.
- [ ] Develop countermeasures to prevent brute-forcing attacks.
